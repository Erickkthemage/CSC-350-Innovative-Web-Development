## Collection of projects completed in this class.

### Week 1 Assignment

This assignment was a simple HTML webpage styled with CSS, that uses the map function of JavaScript to generate a list that dynamically updates whenever the user submits a new entry.

### Week 2 Assignment

This was my first time using a JSON object as well as Bootstrap 5. It's a simple FAQ page that iterates through a JSON object to generate the content for the page.

### Week 3 Assignment

This was my first React component, it simply shows a picture of my favorite show along with the title of the show.

### Week 4 Assignment

Another React application, however, this application stores data in different components that are retrieved from the main app component and then displayed on the page as well as being styled with Bootstrap 5. I also used animations for the first time in this application.

### Week 5 Assignment

This React application was my first time using state to make a color-guessing game. The site randomly chooses a color from an array when you first load the page and then the user submits their guesses and the page updates to reflect if their answer was correct or incorrect. Once the guess is correct the page displays an image with an animation.

### Week 6 Assignment

This was my first attempt at implementing navigation in a React application. It contains two pages and a navigation bar that is styled using Bootstrap 5.

### Week 7 Assignment

This was my final project which consists of four pages that mix everything I learned throughout the course into this one project. It has navigation between four pages, two of the pages use the map function of Javascript to iterate through two different JSON objects to generate the pages. There is also a feature that allows the user to submit input which then dynamically updates the JSON object and then updates the mapped list on the page.
